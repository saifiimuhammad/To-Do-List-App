# Simple To-Do List Web App

This is a straightforward To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a convenient way to manage your tasks without any unnecessary complexity. Perfect for beginners learning web development.

## Features

- **Add Unlimited Tasks**: You can add as many tasks as you want. There are no limits to the number of tasks you can manage.

- **Persistent Data Storage**: Your task list is saved in your browser's local storage. This means that even if you accidentally close the tab or refresh the page, your tasks will still be there when you return.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. You will see a simple interface where you can:
   - Add new tasks: Enter your task in the input field and press "Add Task."
   - Mark tasks as completed: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed.
   - Delete tasks: Click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.
   - Your tasks will be automatically saved, and you can continue working on your to-do list even after closing the tab.

## How It Works

This app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses your browser's local storage to store your task list. When you add, complete, or delete tasks, the app updates the data in your browser's local storage. This ensures your tasks persist across sessions.

## Roadmap

While this app is intentionally kept simple for educational purposes, you can extend it by adding more advanced features like due dates, task prioritization, and user accounts. Feel free to experiment and customize it to match your needs and learning objectives.
